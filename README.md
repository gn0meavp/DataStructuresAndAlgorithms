# Data Structures And Algorithms
Implementations of some data structures and algorithms in Objective-C

Currently implemented:
  - Trie
  - Min Heap
  - Max Heap (w/ sample the kth largest element in an unsorted array)
  - Graph

  - Running Median (w/ using Min Heap and Max Heap)
  
See Tests for samples
